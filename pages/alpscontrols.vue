            <h3>Product Design & Front-end Development</h3>
            <p>From 2016 to present, I've led the redesign and feature development of the customer facing ecommerce platform that eParts licensces to its clients. This was a ground up rewrite and redesign that involved switching to a modern tech stack and design language. I conducted ethnographic interviews in the field in order to create personas that would help us understand user needs and pain points. The new platform has a fresh, re-brandable, mobile responsive interface that is both easier to use and easier on the eyes.</p>

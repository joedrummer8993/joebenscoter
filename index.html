            <p>I'm Joe, a designer passionate about making people's lives better through thoughtful software. I love the challenge of bringing new ideas to life and thrive in the tension of balancing business goals with customer needs.</p>
            <p class="">I've been the sole designer on a small, tight knit product team for the past 5 years building the future of B2B eCommerce. I've lead our team through a complete redesign of our company's core product. Together, we redefined everything from data structures to art direction. I certainly made mistakes along the way, but am very proud of what we were able to accomplish. We've found that thoughtful and prompt communication makes or breaks great product ideas. I am confident in my skills and am excited at the prospect of having an even bigger impact.</p>

                    <p>From 2016 to present, I've led the redesign of the customer facing ecommerce platform that eParts licensces to its clients.  This was a ground up rewrite and redesign that involved switching to a modern tech stack and design language.  I conducted ethnographic interviews in the field in order to create personas that would help us understand user needs and pain points.  The new platform has a fresh, re-brandable, mobile responsive interface that is both easier to use and easier on the eyes.</p>

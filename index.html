            <h3>eParts Services LLC &mdash; APE</h3>
            <p>Starting in 2016 to present, I've lead the redesign of the customer facing ecommerce platform that eParts licensces to its clients.  This was a ground up rewrite and redesign that involved switching to a modern tech stack and design language.  I conducted ethnographic interviews in the field in order to create personas that would help us understand user needs and pain points.  The new platform has a fresh, re-brandable, mobile responsive interface that is both easier to use and easier on the eyes.</p>
